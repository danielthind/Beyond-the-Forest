[deku]	deep in the forest,
		long have i served
		as the guardian spirit

		but now as murky shadows poison me,
		vile beasts descend upon our wilds

		with these wretched shadows
		and darkness clouding my vision
		i am unable to protect these lands

		the time has come for
		you my child to test your resolve
		and take my place

*		camera pans down to wolf (target: player) 		

[deku]	young one...
		this is no dream
		our forest needs you

		wake up!

*		player state:	sleeping -> idle














[deku]	malevolent forces descend upon our wilds

		come now, i summon thee...

* 		original test level intro




The dark side clouds everything. Impossible to see the future is.

		
		talk about planets growing in my crumbling muscles of soil

		a sorrow of fallen trees (reference star wars destruction of alderaan)
"I felt a great disturbance in the Force,
as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror,
and were suddenly silenced.
I fear something terrible has happened."

		listen to my words

		i fear a great sadness rises
		beyond the woodline

		but now as my eternal slumber
		begins to greet me


		once a goliath of fortified earth and
		chain mail bark, i protected these woods
		for ten thousand full moons
